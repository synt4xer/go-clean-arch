# `/cmd`

The `cmd` folder in this Go project structure is designated for the application's entry points. The `cmd` folder serves as the gateway for initializing and starting the application, keeping the main logic and configurations separate from the core business logic. This organization aids in maintaining a clear separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and extensible.
