# `/database`

The `database` folder in this Go project structure is dedicated to managing all database-related operations and configurations. The `database` folder encapsulates the database logic, ensuring a clear separation between the business logic and data access. This organization promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability by isolating database interactions from the core application logic.

## Structure and Contents

The `database` folder typically contains the following components:

1. **Migration Files**:  
   This folder or subdirectory contains database migration scripts, often managed by a migration tool like `golang-migrate`, `goose`, or a custom solution. These scripts are responsible for creating, updating, or rolling back database schema changes.

2. **SQL Queries/Commands**:  
   Any raw SQL queries or commands that are not embedded directly in the repository layer may reside here. This allows for easy modification and review of SQL commands separate from the application code.

3. **Database Configuration**:  
   Files or packages that handle database connection settings, pooling, and initialization logic. This might include connection strings, environment-based configuration files, or structs representing configuration options.

4. **Repository Implementations**:  
   The repository pattern implementations for interacting with the database. These implementations are responsible for converting between database records and domain models, adhering to the Clean Architecture principle of keeping data storage concerns separate from business logic.

5. **Seed Data**:  
   Files or scripts used to populate the database with initial or test data. This might include JSON, CSV, or SQL files that are loaded into the database during development or testing.
