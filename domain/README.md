# `/domain`

The `domain` folder is a crucial part of the Go project structure. It contains the core business logic and entities that define the application's domain. The domain layer is independent of any external systems, frameworks, or databases, ensuring that business rules are central and isolated from technical concerns. This isolation facilitates testability, maintainability, and adaptability.

## Structure and Contents

The `domain` folder typically contains the following components:

1. **Entities**:  
   Entities represent the core business objects and their behaviors. These are plain Go structs with methods that encapsulate the business rules. Entities should be independent of any database, framework, or external system.

2. **Value Objects**:  
   Value objects are immutable objects that represent specific concepts within the domain. They encapsulate certain properties and behaviors but do not have an identity (unlike entities).

3. **Interfaces**:  
   The domain layer defines interfaces for the interactions it requires from the outside world, such as repositories or services. These interfaces allow the domain to remain decoupled from the infrastructure layer, enabling different implementations (e.g., for testing or switching databases).
